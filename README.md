This is the simple code to get insights of Chicago Crime Dataset , where mainly python is used to train the models by using library Sk-learn .
There are mainly 2 model built on this code :
  1. Random FOrest to predict the possibility of arrest if any crime will happen in whihc area and what type of crime it was 
  2. K - Means Algorith based on silhoutte score to know the cluster of crime in areas where Police needs to expand their patrolling and surveillance.


Folium and Matplotlib are used in the code to visulize the outputs and clustering.
HTML files are generated once you run the code !!

There are 2 python files in the Repo , if you want a smaller version of code use P1.py or else use P2.py for detail exploration of data and more better plots.


## Installations Required

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn sklearn folium scipy
